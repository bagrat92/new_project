Linux began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds to create a new
free operating system kernel. 
The resulting Linux kernel has been marked by constant growth throughout its history. Since the initial 
release of its source code in 1991, it has grown from 
a small number of C files under a license prohibiting commercial distribution to the 4.15 version in 2018

Public License v2 with a syscall exception meaning anything that uses the kernel via system 
calls are not subject to the GNU
